📊 Ecommerce Sales Analysis – Key Insights
1️⃣ Overall Business Performance

The platform generated ₹106.6 million in total revenue across 100,000 orders.

The average order value (AOV) is approximately ₹1,066, indicating a moderate basket size.

The customer base consists of 9,000 unique customers, showing a healthy transaction volume per customer.

Business impact:
Revenue scale is strong, but growth will depend more on increasing customer value rather than just order count.

2️⃣ Time-Based Sales Trends

Monthly revenue shows clear variation, indicating seasonal purchasing behavior.

The highest revenue month is May 2024, with revenue of approximately ₹9.28 million.

Sales remain consistently strong across months, with no extreme drops, suggesting stable demand.

Business impact:
High-performing months should be targeted with inventory planning and marketing campaigns to maximize profitability.

3️⃣ Customer Behavior (Repeat vs One-Time)

100% of customers are repeat customers — every customer has placed more than one order.

This indicates strong customer retention and repeat purchasing behavior across the platform.

Business impact:
Customer acquisition strategies appear effective, but the real opportunity lies in upselling, cross-selling, and loyalty-based rewards to increase lifetime value.

4️⃣ Product & Category Performance

Sales are concentrated in a limited number of product categories, which contribute the majority of revenue.

Several categories show lower contribution, indicating potential underperformance or niche demand.

Business impact:
Top-performing categories should be prioritized for promotions, while low-performing categories should be reviewed for pricing, positioning, or discontinuation.

5️⃣ Discount Impact

Discounts significantly affect net revenue, reducing total earnings despite increasing order volume.

Higher discounts do not always translate into proportional revenue growth.

Business impact:
Discount strategies should be data-driven, focusing on targeted offers rather than blanket discounts to protect margins.
